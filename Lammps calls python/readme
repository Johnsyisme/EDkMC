To avoid hundreds of thousands of initiation procedure of LAMMPS, we tried to use `LOOP` in LAMMPS to call PYTHON to do the Monte-Carlo procedure. 
In this way,  you can use `lmp -i in.lammps` to finish all simulation with only one launch of LAMMPS, which will reduce the conputaion time effectively.

But for some interatomic potential, the `clear` commands cannot clear all the data in memoriy, as a result, there will be OOM issue after finite loops.
If we want to do a long time simulation, we need to restart the LAMMPS constantly to continue the simulation when the job killed by OOM.
So we use the `in.resume.bak` as the restart input file, when the previous job get killed, `run.sh` will copy the `in.resume.bak` to `in.resume`, and reset the MC steps in `in.resume.bak` to continume the job
